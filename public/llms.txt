## Core Idea

VFriend was born out of frustration:  
Instead of digging through WhatsApp/Discord chats for timetables, or spamming friends with *“Where are you?”* messages, one tap now shows you who's free, where they are, and what spots are chill.  

- **Fully Offline**, No internet required  
- **Transparent**, Open source & verifiable  
- **Minimal Data**, Only timetable, name, reg. no, and hangout spots stored locally
