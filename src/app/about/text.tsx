            If you've asked me this question back in <strong>2023</strong>, I'd
            have said it's a <strong className="font-bold">script</strong> for
            me to keep track of my friends' timetables. Never have I ever
            thought it'd become an app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost about{" "}

              {new Date().getFullYear() - 2023}
            </strong>{" "}
            years ago, while I was a freshman at my college, I had an oddly
            specific problem of having a little{" "}
            <MarkImportant>too many friends</MarkImportant>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oftentimes, I'd often find myself digging through old{" "}
            <MarkImportant>WhatsApp/Discord</MarkImportant> chats, trying to
            find the timetables they had sent me, one by one, over and over.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was tedious, repetitive, and honestly, a little ridiculous. I
            kept thinking, there has to be a{" "}
            <MarkImportant>better way</MarkImportant> to do this.
          </p>
          <p>
            But back then, I didn't know much about app development. I had spent
            time learning web dev, but even now, as I write this, you could say,
            this is my first real app.
